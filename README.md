The overall concept of this project to to recreate an ecact replica that is from part of a website. I took this project as a kind of warm-up for my freedom project to see how i can tinker with css and html. I had to learn a lot on my own in order to achieve different aspects for my replica, it gave me a chance to increase my knowledge in both HTMl and CSS.
